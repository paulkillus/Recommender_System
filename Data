Data Acquisition and Cleaning
  I will soly use Foursquare APIs for data acquisition.
  First, I will use "Search for venues" API to find the restaurants.
    GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search
  I will choose Finch Subway Station as centre point, and find venues under "Chinese Restaurant" category, with distance <8km
  to the centre point. The API gives me 50 results, in which we only need the venue_id, location(latitude and longitude), and 
  name of the vanues.
  Secondly, I will use "Get Users Who Liked a Venue" to find the users who gave likes to these restaurants.
    GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/VENUE_ID/likes
  The free API only gave me three users per venue, even there are hundreds of likes in some of the venues. However, we still
  found some users gave more than one venues likes. So we can use this information to create clusters of the venues.
  But I still want more data, so I use "Get a Venue's Tips" to collect more information.
    GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/VENUE_ID/tips
  The free API will give us 2 tips for each venue. To analyse the tips, I installed a python package "FuzzyWuzzy" that can compare
  two strings and give their similarity value. I will use the values to build a matrix, which will also contribute to the modeling.
