Introduction
  Background
      Toronto has the best Chinese restaurants in North America, and it is a highly diverse city. Many new immigrants choose Toronto 
    as their first place to live in Canada, and there is also a huge internation student community, which provides lots of business 
    opportunities. Many new immigrants and students like Chinese cuisine, while there is not a good platform that give recommendations 
    of the Chinese restaurants based on data. 
Business Problem
      I want to build a recommendation system that suggests your next place to eat based on the places your have been to, the infomation
    about the venues including users likes and tips, the locations, etc. so the customers will get a short list of recommendations that
    fit their taste.
      This recommendation system can be used in services and applications like food delivery (UberEats) or online-seat-booking platform. 
    With the understanding of customers' preference, the business/application could also send promotion messages to their users to increase
    the revenue and create better customers experience.
